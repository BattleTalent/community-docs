# Introduction

TemplateWizard is a tool that helps you generate MOD content. It assists in creating:

- File structures and directories
- Required Prefabs
- Game configuration files (CONFIG)
- Pre-configured Lua script files (available in certain templates)

This tool streamlines the MOD development process by automatically generating the necessary components and basic framework, allowing you to focus more on implementing your unique MOD features rather than setting up the basic structure.

All information entered during the template generation process is stored in CONFIG files. Don't worry if you need to make temporary entries - you can modify any settings in these CONFIG files at any time before submitting your MOD.

## How to Use
1. Go to `Tools -> Template Wizard` in the menu
2. Fill in the required information in the wizard
3. Click "Generate Template" to create your MOD structure
