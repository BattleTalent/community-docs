title: Upgrade & vulnerability colors are not showing
---

Upgrade and vulnerability colors will be set by the "skill change colors" property of the "interact trigger" component. But there are some important things to watchout for.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Go to map with enemies.
1. Spawn your weapon.
1. Hit the enemy until you weapon is almost broken.
1. See that your weapon does not change color.

## Fix

* The added meshes should have a material where emmision is turned on.
* The added meshes should have a material where emmision does not have an emmision map texture.
* The added meshes should have a material where emmision map texture color is set to 1,1,1,0.
