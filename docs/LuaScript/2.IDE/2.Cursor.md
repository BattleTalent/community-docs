1. First, provide the sample weapon code from MTK to AI for analysis:  
    ![AI Code Generation Example 1](./cursor/analysis.jpg)  
    get:  
    ![AI Code Generation Example 2](./cursor/analysis_result.png)
2. Then, describe your weapon requirements, let AI generate new weapon based on the sample:  
    ![AI Code Generation Example 3](./cursor/weapon_requirements.png)  
    get:  
    ![AI Code Generation Example 4](./cursor/code_generated.png)
3. Copy the generated code to your project and adjust it as needed.
4. Test the weapon in the game to ensure it works as expected.
