## How to use Lua in this project

In this project, Lua scripting is mainly implemented through the following components:

1. LuaBehavior - Basic Lua script component that can be added to any GameObject
2. InteractTriggerX - Component for adding interaction trigger functionality
3. FlyObjectX - Component for controlling object flight behavior

You can add these components to your GameObjects and write corresponding Lua scripts to implement custom functionality.
