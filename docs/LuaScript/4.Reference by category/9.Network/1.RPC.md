# RPC - Server to Client

   The server calls the client function using Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

   A function that needs to be called on the client:

   ```
   function WeaponFlyObj:RpcOnShoot(bullet)
       --client to do
   end
   ```

   

   Registering Function in NetworkInject so that the client can find the same function and run it when the server calls it.

   ```
   function WeaponFlyObj:NetworkInject()
       self.host.interact.networkIB.networkIBState:InjectFunc("RpcOnShoot", self.RpcOnShoot)
       --inject other function
   end
   ```

   

   The server uses the interface `ServerRpcIntFunc` (Please read `NetworkIBStateX` for more interfaces) in networkIBState to call functions in the client. (RpcOnShoot). 

   ​	other interface refer to `NetworkIBStateX`

   ServerRpcIntFunc(funtionName, int, includeServer)

   - functionName: The name of the function to be called on the client
   - int:  int value
   - includeServer: run this function on the server as well，In this case, includeServer is false, so it will only run RpcOnShoot on the client side.

   ```
   function WeaponFlyObj:ServerOnShoot(bullet)
       self.host.interact.networkIB.networkIBState:ServerRpcIntFunc("RpcOnShoot", bullet.netId, false)
   end
   ```
