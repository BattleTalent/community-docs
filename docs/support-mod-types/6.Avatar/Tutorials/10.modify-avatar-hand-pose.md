# Modify Avatar HandPose

Note: The prefixes used in the tutorial are "WMD\_", which can be replaced with your own prefix, and you will need to change the prefix in the AddressableConfig(Assets/Resources/AddressableConfig) file. Once you have changed the prefix, you will need to fill in your new prefix instead of "WMD\_" in the tutorial.

Using the hand with the HandPoseTool placed:

1. You can press **Trigger** to select the parameter to be modified.
1. Use the **joystick** to adjust the values.

#### 4.Use adjusted values

Back to  [Create a avatar mod](create-an-avatar-mod) step 6. Use the adjusted values on your `AvatarInfo`, taking care to distinguish between left and right handedness.
