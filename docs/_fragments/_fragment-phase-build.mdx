### 1. Update all addressables.

* Go to **AddressableConfig**(`Assets > Resources > AddressableConfig`) or use shortcut: `ctrl+shift+e`.
* Click `Clear Addressables` and `Create And Refresh Addressable Name`.

Then you will see this tool has already setup addressable path for you in the **Addressables Groups** window. (**Window/Asset Management/Addressables/Groups** to open this window)
