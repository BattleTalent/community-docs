## Tutorial videos

If you dont like reading a lot there is also some tutorial videos out there that are easy to follow.

### 10 minutes Tutorial Video

Fonzie made an [official modding tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqPl5KRgZ8Y) to quickly get going. It can be a little hard to follow sometimes but it gets the job done quickly.

### Extensive Tutorial Video

One of our finest modders has created an [extensive tutorial video](https://youtu.be/5o_1-wd6MiI) on how to create a mod. Completely voiced and all. I personally recommend watching this video.
