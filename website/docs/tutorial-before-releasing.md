---
Before you release your own mod there are a couple of things you should do.

## Clear the project

Two ways to clear the project of examples

* Remove the pre-added addressables `window -> asset management -> addressables -> group`
* Delete the Examples folder `Assets/Examples`

## Renamed the product

The way to change product name
`Edit -> Project Settings ->` Modify the Project Name

## Renamed all prefixes

Not written yet. Ask in Discord about it.

## Add an icon

Make sure an icon is added, else the store will crash.

## No errors

Open the cheat menu in-game & make sure no errors are shown when spawning the weapon. It will cause unexpected issues throughout the game.
